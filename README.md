#K-Pop Stat Tracker
Project designed to do comparative analysis on various K-Pop video views.  I'll start with trying to pull and analyze data from YouTube, then turn that into a dashboard to tracks relative popularity (views) of various groups over time. Despite the name, I may also add data for variety shows I like.

I may also add Wikipedia data to see who had pages and how often they're updated? Perhaps YouTube comment activity?
